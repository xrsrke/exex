## Pseudo code

Problems - If store value of a property inside the object - One property
can belong to two different laws. So if that property change, which law
need to be change?

##### Example 11: What volume of $\mathrm{CO}_2$ is generated from $1.0 \mathrm{g}$ $\mathrm{C}_{6}\mathrm{H}_{12} \mathrm{O}_6$ reacting at $293 \mathrm{k}$ and $0.984 \mathrm{~atm}$ ?

$\mathrm{C}_6 \mathrm{H}_{12} \mathrm{O}_6 (\mathrm{s}) \rightarrow 2 \mathrm{C}_2 \mathrm{H}_{6} \mathrm{O}(l)+2 \mathrm{CO}_2(\mathrm{~g})$

``` python
# from universe import our_universe
```

``` python
# system = System()
```

``` python
# C6H12O6 = Compound('C6H12O6', 'solid')
```

``` python
# C2H6O = Compound('C2H6O', 'liquid')
```

``` python
# CO2 = Compound('CO2', 'gas')
```

``` python
# open_container = OpenContainer()
```

``` python
# r = Reaction(reactants=[C6H12O6], product=[C2H6O, CO2],
#              catalyst=[],
#              environment=open_container, system=system)
```

The current timestep is None

``` python
# final_state = system.set_time(-1)
```

After set mass, the system auto generated all properties of other
component at that timestep

``` python
# final_state.compound(C6H12O6).setMass('1.0 g')
```

``` python
# initial_state = system.set_time(1)
```

``` python
# initial_state.compound(CO2).getVolume()
```
